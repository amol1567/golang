Why Golang:
Python, Java, C/C++ - Each of this language within itself is very powerful, however 
the Go designer study & the recognize some limitaions that might not to be able to 
fix in the history of the design of existing languages.
Python - Easy to use(but slow) but it is interpreter language so it can be little bit 
         difficult to run an application based on python.
Java - Java is very quick but its type system has become increasingly complex over time.
C/C++ - It is also very quick, however it suffers from complex type system and also 
        complie times is slow.

Go (golang):
     - Go programs are compiled to native machine code, which makes Go much faster than the 
       majority of other interpreted languages.
     - Strong(type of variable can not changed over time) and statically(type of variable 
       is defined at compile time) typed language.
     - Excellent community(Strong support for community that focusing on it).
     - Key features (Simplicity, Fast compile times, Garbage collection(go runtime is going 
       to manage memory)
     - Built-in concurrency
     - Compile to standalone binaries(when you complie your Go application everything is 
       going to be binary in that single binary that realted to the Go application itself.
       Go runtime is binary living their, any libaries that you are depending on they are 
       going to be compiles in their so you not have worry about reaching any exeternal 
       libaries and disallows to make your application works. Giving version management at 
       runtime becomes trivial.
